The point of this project is to create a simple API which parses geojson (specifically a polygon or multipolygon) to the server, it then uses starspan to summarise raster cells that fall within the polygon (bit like ESRIs zonal statistics- but on the web- and free :-))


There is a bunch of stuff to install first:

GDAL
GEOS
starspan
a bunch of gems


starspan instructions below (which by the way is ace and pretty fast):  

download and unpack starspan from: http://projects.atlas.ca.gov/frs/?group_id=48&release_id=297

Terminal:
!!!!!this may vary depending on where you have GDAL and GEOS installed!!!!!

sudo ./configure --with-gdal=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.6/Programs/gdal-config --with-geos=/Library/Frameworks/GEOS.framework/Versions/3/Programs/geos-config 

sudo make
sudo make install


you'll also need a few gems (will package this together eventually)

sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install json
sudo gem install rio
sudo gem install fastercsv

I use httparty to test the services were working ok so if you want to do the same you'll need

sudo gem install httparty
