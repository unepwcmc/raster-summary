The point of this project is to create a simple API which parses geojson (specifically a polygon or multipolygon) to the server, it then uses starspan to summarise raster cells that fall within the polygon (bit like ESRIs zonal statistics- but on the web- and free :-))

If you want to use it yourself you will need to get your own raster (in WGS84) and put it in the raster folder then alter the code to point to your raster [will abstract this shortly too]


There is a bunch of stuff to install first:

GDAL
GEOS
starspan
a bunch of gems


starspan instructions below (which by the way is ace and pretty fast):  

download and unpack starspan from: http://projects.atlas.ca.gov/frs/download.php/645/starspan-1.0.08f.tgz

Terminal:
!!!!!this may vary depending on where you have GDAL and GEOS installed - just locate geos-config and gdal-config to find the right path!!!!!

sudo ./configure --with-gdal=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.6/Programs/gdal-config --with-geos=/Library/Frameworks/GEOS.framework/Versions/3/Programs/geos-config 

sudo make
sudo make install


you'll also need a few gems (will package this together eventually)

sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install json
sudo gem install rio
sudo gem install fastercsv

I use httparty to test the services were working ok so if you want to do the same you'll need

sudo gem install httparty
